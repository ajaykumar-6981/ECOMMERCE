Review    Liked
The rug was as pictured and good for the price.  However it had a very strong mustymoldy odor so I exchanged it and the replacement also had an odor but not as bad so I had to return it.  Maybe I had a bad draw or maybe that’s the way wool can smell.  It might not bother everyone and I didn’t give it time to air out since it irritated my throat.,0
"Really lovely rug. Gorgeous colors and nice thick pile. Good, heavy weight lays nicely. Very unique pattern.",1
This was an absolutely beautiful rug. Very nice quality exactly what I was looking for.,1
"This design catches the eye of everyone that comes to Customer’s house, even though it’s partially underneath a dining room table",1
"The color of the rug is mostly the same as pictured except for the orange flowers, which appear way darker in the photos. In real life, they are a much lighter orange. This is fine with me though. The quality seems great and it's a nice, thick, comfortable rug.",1

High quality rug that looks great. Very happy with the purchase and with my Wayfair experience.,1
"Nice rug - beautiful colors and nice foot feel.  However, we did have to vacuum the rug quite thoroughly when we fist unrolled it and basically filled half a trash bag with what we pulled out of the rug when we were finally finished vacuuming.  We love the rug and hope it will last for many years.  I'd definitely recommend to a friend.",1

"Really like the rug! Color is a little darker than whats online but overall, good! Delivery was great.",1
"The rug is absolutely beautiful and perfect for the area.  I am concerned as the rug arrived with a musty smell, which has dissipated somewhat but there is still a lingering, faint smell. Hoping this resolves as we really like the rug.  The colors are a bit more muted than what the picture shows, however, I really like the colors.",1
It’s a beautiful rug awesome choice.,1
Definitely not cream; more of a light brown or beige. Overall it's quite dark. In the photo you see it is very light with blue flowers but the flowers are gray and the other designs (where blue in photo) are actually green.,0
Quick ordering and delivery. Awesome rug,1
Great Rug with excellent quality,1
Beautiful rug but it smelled of mildew. Wayfair offered to pay for cleaning but there was no guarantee that the smell would be gone. I opted to send it back.  Wayfair was great in resolving the issue.,1

"Fabulous rug, looks great and of high quality. Be aware that will shed quite a bit for a while. Needs regular vacuuming and will have “fluff balls” coming off of it for a while after purchase. May also be a few inches bigger than quoted size",1

This rug adds wonderful color to our play area for my grandson. The sides are finished well and the color is rich. The rug pad made it super comfortable as well.,1
Soft rug. The color is true to the pictures.,1
This rug is well made and looks amazing in a basement bar. I think it will wear very well also.,1
true to picture and for a wool rug the price can't be beat. it is thin however and because pf this it is liable to stretch a bit when placing it under heavy furniture. all in all though it is a bargain.,1

"The color is much lighter than pictured.  It’s a dingy beige and the pattern is very faint.  Unfortunately, ours arrived with dirty spots.  Too expensive to return, so I will be donating.",1
Nice quality. And arrived promptly,1
Not bad.,1
"Don't believe the pictures.  It is a very bland, smelly, rug.  It looks in the photos to have some variation in the brown, maybe reds, but, NOPE.  My house smells like an alpaca!  YUK!",0

"This was beautiful, but it was stained, cut wrong, and it has a toxic smell! Couldn’t even keep it in the house!",1
I’d give it a 5 but the smell is ￼atrocious. ￼ It makes my small room smell really strongly of chemicals. It might not be do pungent on a larger room. I am hoping it was just treated with something and it wears off.,1
Love!,1
"Pretty design but unable to keep it from shedding, always looks dirty no matter how much I vacuum!",1

Love it! In my study and it has a beautiful appeal!,1
The carpet that was delivered to my studio was florescent green and black. NOTHING like the rug in the image. Now im being told that it cannot be replaced.,0
"The colors on the website and the actual color of the rug are very different.  The blue is more of a denim blue, not sky blue.  The green is more gold than green.  I am not sure I will keep.  It does smell as many have mentioned.",0
"Color  is more of a blue with black (what looks like shadows in the pic is actually black). Works for me, is in sons room and the depth is actually perfect so he won’t trip over it. And color looks great in boys room.",1

Love this rug! It is soft and fuzzy and it looks awesome in my living room!,1
Great rug but the darker green is actually black and the bright green blended. Still very cool and it’s a soft shag.,1
"love my rugs, beautiful! fit in with my room décor beautifully",1
Need to return this due to its outdoor natural  coir rug smell. They say it should go away but it hasn’t. Otherwise cute.,0
"Beautiful rug and great heft. It is plush and looks wonderful in our living room. We could not keep, however, because something in the wool, dye, glue, or canvas backing irritated our allergies. Otherwise, we would have kept!",1

I liked that this blended with our dark hardwood floors. It still sheds after months of vacuuming.,1

"First of all, the rug is completely different colors than the pictures online. It is definitely more teal-toned than various shades of light to dark blue. Totally throws off the room now. Second, it collects everything on it which makes it seem dirty constantly. And it arrived with a very strong smell - I’m thinking it’s the dye? And the smell remains to this day. And beware of color transfer. If I sit on it or wear light colored shoes or socks, the blue transfers. Very disappointed for the price I paid for it.",1
This is such a plush and cozy rug. More beautiful than the picture. Absolutely love it.,1
"BEAUTIFUL, PLUSH, LUSCIOUS AND PERFECT!! IT IS MORE BRILLIANT AND COLORFUL THAN PICTURED. WISH I HAD AN AREA FOR THE LARGEST RUG. THANK YOU!!!",1

Paid 559 so expected much better quality",0
"Absolutely love this rug!  It is soft, the color is exactly what it looks like.  The only thing I might do different is get a pad for it because it does slide on my flooring.  But don’t get me wrong, the quality of the rug is superb!!!",1

"Overall I really like this rug.  The color was spot on from the photo.  I really like the size, however, one end was not square.  I kept it because I could put it in a blind spot.  It's wool and it sheds but manageable.",1
"Great rug perfect for my area, got the 8X10, thick and really good quality wool rug!",1
Wasn't sure this rug would work in the room for which I purchased it.  It does and have been enjoying it!,0
"My home features stone flooring on the ground level and hardwood upstairs, and I have purchased several area rugs of decent quality but not particularly ""high-end"" for the rooms I frequent in the interest of aesthetics and comfort. My latest purchase, this hand-knotted wool area rug for the master suite is by far the finest rug I own despite having paid far more for a few of the others.

I would describe this rug combined with a one-half inch felt pad as synonymous with walking on a pile of cashmere sweaters; it is truly luxurious. I wouldn't expect this fine rug to be suitable for high traffic areas, but for my bedroom, I am thrilled with my purchase. In addition to the wonderful feel, it is well constructed and has a beautiful sheen and attractive color variations.

I am extremely pleased with this purchase and highly recommend to others.",1

"J'ai bien reçu mon tapis, mais je suis trés déçue car ce n'est le même rouge vif écarlate de la photo, le tapis que j'ai reçu est de couleur rouge vin et les petits traits de bordures ne sont pas orange et vert etc...mais d'un beige fade. Pourquoi ce ne sont pas les même couleurs??",1
I ended up returning this as the color was really off- it was a copper orange and I was hoping for a golden ginger/ mustard shade. The product itself was very nice though- beautiful wool.,1
Love Color &  Material. Perfect!,1
Quality rug,1
"I like it but it always seems to look messy, lots of little white threads showing",1
"Love the color, it was true to photo.  As others have remarked 1)  it sheds incredibly at first vacuum but the knap lifts beautifully 2) again as others stated, it absolutely had an atrocious odor, like damp, musty, mildewy.  It's dissipating.  I carefully inspected and that wasn't happening.  I can only attribute that issue to the natural fiber content.  Lastly, it is not a traditionally structured rug.  It is a very soft backing like bath rugs.  Some may want to add a pad or secure with rug tape.  The hand of the natural fiber is luxurious feeling under the feet.  Overall very pleased with it.",1
Color is gorgeous but vacuuming it is a nightmare because it suck ip so much of the material.,1
"This rug has been used and is in poor condition, obviously used with unsightly worn areas. We were truly disgusted and did not want this in our home.  We ask that Wayfairer customer service reach out to arrange paid return and refund.  We have pictures to share from our iphones.",1
"This rug smells terrible like a chemical smell. maybe dyes or treated with something. We have been airing it out ever since we got it a couple of weeks ago and it’s not better. The color, etc. are fine. Disappointing.",0

Fell apart in just a few months (just past the last day to return it). So disappointed! Had to throw it away.,0
"This rug is very thick and soft, but very hard to keep clean. Every time I vacuum it, the vacuum is filled with green fibers, but the rug itself does not look clean. It holds dog hair very strongly. I ended up throwing it out after 2 years due to it being so hard to clean and it was making my son’s allergies worse.",0
"Wonderful value.  You cannot purchase the wool and pay the cost of hand weaving, for the delivered product. Nice underfoot too",1
The only thing I like about it is the color. It keeps losing wool which is now all over the house given that it sticks to shoes and socks. Definitely not well hand knotted. Ver disappointed,1
"Both rug and padding are perfect! Right style, size, and fit!",1
"Looked all over for a dark red area rug for our living room. Didn’t want shag or cheap and red is a tough color to get right. This is exactly what we wanted, cost more than the polyester ones but it looks good and appears to be made to last. It did have a smell at first, but it wasn’t horrible and did go away. The color is rich looking and perfect for our room.",1
"Not my favorite Wayfair purchase, unfortunately. Love the color, but the rug sheds quite a bit and was a bit thinner than I expected.",0

It is nice though every time I vacuum it (6 times so far) it completely fills my bagless vacuum canister. Hopefully that will lessen.,1

"The color is great, but each time I vacuum, the cannister is filled with red wool. I purchased this in August, and it continues to shed. Im waiting for the time when it just vanishes.",0
"Great color, only problem is how much it sheds but only notice that really when vacuuming.",1
The rug is beautiful and what I had hoped for but I was extremely disappointed that it smelled horribly musty.,1
"I know Wayfair doesn't ship rugs, they just handle the orders. This rug came with both ends zip tied, not the usual competent packaging of another rug I bought from Wayfair. When I cut the zip ties and started to pull out the rug, it smelled terrible. It was moldy or something.  Wayfair has great customer service and are not charging for the return, as it should be.",0
I love the look of the rug but it sheds a ridiculous amount. I do not know how long the shedding will continue. it is driving me crazy.,1
Love the color. It really brightens up the place!!,1

"Le tapis présente une belle couleur et sa laine est douce. 
Cependant, après un mois depuis sa réception, j'ai remarqué que des brins de laine se détachent. Cela donne l'impression d'une qualité inférieure.",1
"I underestimated how much dirt a dark rug shows. It needs daily vacuuming. That said, it is soft and looks quite pretty.",1
This rug is beautiful and well made. It did shed the first time I vacuumed it but I'm hopeful that it's pretty much okay going forward. The color is so bright and looks gorgeous on my red oak hardwood floor in my kitchen.,1
"Rug is a beautiful deep red, but was disappointed that one side does not have a straight edge. Pile is a nice height.",1
"Rug looks beautiful but each time I. Vacuumed the rug, I had to empty the canister twice. The rug keeps on shedding fibers in clumps. Seems that there is something wrong with the rug.",1

"I received the rug today and its beautiful.
The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because there are areas in the rug that have a light brown discoloration. However, after notifying Wayfair of the issue it was quickly resolved.",1
"Beautiful rug, but I can’t seem to get the mildewmust odor out of it so it’s in the garage now. I tried everything",1
"Received rug in very timely manner. Love the pattern and the light rust/coral, creams, tans and light blue colors. Nice quality (dense, firm, heavy) for the price.  However
 the moldy odor needs eliminated  before I can use in my living room.  Have started with baking soda sprinkled all over the backside and put it outside  on porch for airing.  Again colors are great,  just what I wanted,  but the moldy/musty smell is big disappointment.",0
"Nice wool rug, and the colors are as depicted online. The width of the rug is about an inch shy of 6’, however.",1

The product is good and prices are Great.,1
Unfortunately the rug we received was not the same as what is shown. We received a rug with white llamas and flowers on it... but it had the same SKU so there is a mistake on the website. Thankfully Wayfair's customer service was very helpful in getting this resolved and refunded.,0
"It's a beautiful shade of brown, and perfect because I didn't want big rugs in my bedroom. I bought two of these, and I did have to air them outside because they had a very ""natural fiber"" smell upon opening, and it triggered a slight allergic response (I have mild seasonal allergies). But that fixed it. All good now, and highly recommend!",1
Rug looks great in my loft!,1
"Very pretty rug. Only problem is that it is very fuzzy, and my vacuum robot needs to go empty itself constantly because of the excess fuzz. The material is somewhat ""weird.""",1

"This carpet is not at all like pictured. It is navy blue with a lot of very bright red.  I had to return it because it wasn’t even close to the colors of my room. It is not as described. What’s worse, it cost me 140 to ship it back.  I wouldn’t have returned it had the colors been as they were described. Warfare has the worst customer service and return policy for some thing that was not your fault. They have lost me as a customer forever!",1

Love shopping at Wayfair!",1
"I bought this ottoman to contrast with a modern swivel armchair that also came from Wayfair. It is real leather and absolutely beautiful. The quality is excellent. It's firm enough to use as a seat. The leather looks ""soft"", but is actually harder than appearance so very difficult to scratch/ damage and should not show water stains if something were to spill on it. I expect it will be very durable. The bottom of the ottoman is thick canvas that will not scratch my wood floors. It is the perfect height and I could not be happier.",1
The poof is a great size and color. The leather is a bit hard so using it fabric side up for now. It does have a distinct smell that needs to dissipate so don’t leave it in a shut room for very long initially.,1
Looks like tie dye,1
Love this,1
These are gorgeous and the sale price made greeting two of these an easy decision. They are both firm and soft. Great ottoman and extra seating.,1
"Great ottoman, sturdy and matches my décor perfectly. A little pricey but hey, it’s genuine leather. I would absolutely recommend.",1
Its a great accent to my living room! quality material and looks fantastic,1
Just as pictured. Husband loves it.,1
"Like the ottomans, however one of them arrived defective",1
The ottoman was the right size & height.  It had good leather & was well made.  Another good buy from Wayfair.  We've bought everything from toilets to this ottoman from Wayfair.,1
Great size. True to a vintage blue color. Quality made. Would buy again!,1
Love. Great quality for the price. Happy with the leather. Looks great in the room with light colored rug and neutral tones.,1
green color is darker and more even in real life. Leather is gorgeous and it isn’t too squishy so you can sit on it.,1
